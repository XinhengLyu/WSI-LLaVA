The cellular architecture demonstrates glandular formations that maintain a semblance of normal tissue architecture but with some deviation, consistent with moderate differentiation. The nuclei of the tumor cells exhibit moderate variability in size and shape, with evident pleomorphic features. The mitotic activity indicates a moderate rate of cell division. There is no observed vascular invasion or necrosis on the examined slide. Additionally, there is no presence of calcification. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma."

The tumor cells form irregular glandular structures that deviate from the normal architecture, demonstrating intermediate differentiation. Nuclear pleomorphism is noted, with mild to moderate variability in nuclear size and shape. Mitotic activity is present, indicative of a moderate rate of cell division. Discontinuous invasion into the surrounding tissue is observed, though lymphovascular invasion is not identified. The tumor does not involve any of the 10 examined regional lymph nodes. Granulomatous inflammation is also noted in the left lobe liver biopsies, characterized by noncaseating granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes, with minimal central necrosis. Calcification consistent with fat necrosis is observed in the pelvic peritoneal nodule. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma."

Tumor cells exhibit moderate nuclear pleomorphism and have invaded into the subserosa, demonstrating destructive stromal invasion. Angiolymphatic invasion is present, indicating the tumor's capacity to invade blood and lymphatic vessels, although perineural invasion is absent. The tumor displays a low-grade morphology overall. Necrosis and specific calcifications were not noted. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma."

The tumor exhibits areas of fibrosis and vascular invasion, as evidenced by tumor emboli within endothelial-lined spaces. There is a moderate level of differentiation as characterized by glandular structures more akin to normal colonic epithelium, classifying it as a low-grade adenocarcinoma. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma."
