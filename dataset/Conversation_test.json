Papillary structures are prominently formed, typical of papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1, featuring fibrovascular cores surrounded by cells with small, oval nuclei. The second component consists of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, characterized by cells with clear cytoplasm and distinct cell borders forming nests and tubules. No evidence of perinephric fat invasion, renal sinus invasion, or renal vein involvement is observed, indicating the neoplasm is confined to the kidney."
