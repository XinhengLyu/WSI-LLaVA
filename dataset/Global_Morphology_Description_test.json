The tumor is characterized by a high nuclear grade, notable pleomorphism, and irregular mitotic figures. Notably, necrosis and calcification are absent in this section. There is also significant squamous metaplasia within the tumor, adding complexity to the microscopic architecture."

These glands are dispersed within the fibromuscular tissue, disrupting the typical architecture. The glandular cells display a distinct arrangement, forming complex patterns with noticeable irregularities in their structure and spacing."
