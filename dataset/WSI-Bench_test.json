Discontinuous invasion into the surrounding tissue is observed, though lymphovascular invasion is not identified. The tumor does not involve any of the 10 examined regional lymph nodes. Granulomatous inflammation is also noted in the left lobe liver biopsies, characterized by noncaseating granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes, with minimal central necrosis. Calcification consistent with fat necrosis is observed in the pelvic peritoneal nodule. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma."
