Symptomatic Management: If the patient experiences symptoms related to FNH, such as pain or discomfort, non-invasive measures are preferred. Analgesics or other symptomatic treatments may be prescribed as needed.  3. Surgery: Surgical resection is generally reserved for symptomatic lesions that do not respond to conservative measures, or for cases where there is uncertainty in the diagnosis and malignancy cannot be excluded.    4. Avoidance of Hormonal Contraceptives: Females should be advised to avoid high-dose estrogen oral contraceptives as these can sometimes cause the lesion to grow.

Endocrine Therapy: If the tumor expresses hormone receptors such as ER or PR, initiate endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for at least 5 years."

Adjuvant Therapy: While not typically used for in situ cases, the patient’s overall health, preferences, and any emerging risk factors may guide the consideration of targeted therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors if specific genetic mutations are identified. 4. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Though more common in advanced stages, consider discussing clinical trials or future use of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 inhibitors if there is significant risk or progression. 5. Genetic Counseling and Testing: Test for mutations like BRAF, NRAS, or c-KIT, which could guide future targeted therapies if progression occurs."
