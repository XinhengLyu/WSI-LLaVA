Surgery: Options include mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, depending on tumor characteristics and patient preference, followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection. 2. Chemotherapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered due to nodal involvement (N1A). 3. Endocrine Therapy: Initiate tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for at least 5 years, as the tumor is estrogen receptor-positive. 4. Radiation Therapy: Recommended, particularly if breast-conserving surgery is selected or in the presence of significant nodal involvement."
