The moderate level of mitotic activity, scored as 2 out of 3, is evident from a relatively high number of mitotic figures visible in the tissue. Additionally, within the areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), there are focal regions of central necrosis, where cell death has led to the formation of necrotic centers within the affected ducts. The presence of calcification is also noted, further contributing to the variety of cellular morphologies observed on the slide."
