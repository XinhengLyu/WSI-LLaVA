The architecture predominantly lacks keratinization, aligning with a non-keratinizing histological variant. Morphological assessment indicates poorly differentiated squamous cells with grade III differentiation, characterized by highly disorganized cell arrangements and pronounced pleomorphism. There is moderate tumor necrosis indicating areas of cell death, but no evidence of lymphatic, venous, or arterial invasion by the tumor. Additionally, non-neoplastic lung tissue exhibits signs of emphysema, pointing to alveolar damage and airspace enlargement. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma, non-keratinizing type, poorly differentiated (grade III)."

Moderate nuclear enlargement and variability in nuclear shape are noted, reflecting pleomorphism. Vascular invasion is observed with tumor emboli in small veins, indicative of aggressive behavior and potential for metastasis. The surrounding liver tissue exhibits signs of fatty dystrophy, characterized by the accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes. The analysis also notes the presence of a Metavir fibrosis score of 1 and a Knodell histological activity index score of 1, indicating early stages of fibrosis and minimal necroinflammatory activity, respectively. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma."

The Gleason score is recorded as 4+3=7, indicating a predominance of poorly formed glandular patterns with fused glands and cribriform structures. A minor microscopic component of Gleason pattern 5, accounting for less than 1% of the tumor, suggests the presence of more aggressive, non-forming glandular structures. There is multifocal extracapsular extension of the tumor, indicating that the cancer cells have penetrated beyond the prostate capsule into surrounding tissues, particularly around regions such as the seminal vesicle and various parts of the prostate base and apex. Noteworthy is the observation of perineural invasion, where cancer cells are seen encircling or tracking along nerves. There are also areas showing high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which is a precursor lesion. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is prostatic adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated, with a Gleason score of 4+3=7."

There is significant lymphocytic infiltration and palisading observed. Vascular invasion is noted, along with clusterized bleeding. The tumor exhibits a hyaloid conga form, with cellular features indicating squamoid cells, glandular cells, and fibroblast presence. Additionally, there is evidence of cell stratification. Keratin secretion and desmosome formations are present, with some intracytoplasmic vacuoles and pearl formation. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is papillary carcinoma."

The tumor is infiltrated with a heavy lymphoplasmacytic presence within the stroma, yet these infiltrates are absent from the tumor cell islands. The carcinoma extends into the thickened fibrous pleura but does not infiltrate the pleural surface. No evidence of lymphatic or vascular invasion is observed. Additionally, there is obstructive pneumonitis observable in the vicinity of the tumor, while the more distant lung parenchyma exhibits signs of centracinar emphysema. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma."

The architecture shows a flat growth pattern with carcinoma in situ, involving surface urothelium and von Brunn's nests. There is evidence of ulceration, necrosis, and a foreign body giant cell reaction, possibly related to prior surgical intervention. No vascular invasion is apparent. Prostate tissue exhibits glandular structures consistent with adenocarcinoma, showing a Gleason score of 7 (4+3) with a small component of Gleason grade 5, indicating poorly differentiated tumoral cells in a more aggressive pattern. The cancer extends beyond the prostate, as suggested by the extraprostatic extension, and perineural invasion is also noted. Based on these observations, the diagnosis is urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder and prostatic adenocarcinoma."
