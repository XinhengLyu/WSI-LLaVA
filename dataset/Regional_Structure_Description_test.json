The nuclear features are relatively uniform, with mild pleomorphism and no substantial atypia observed. There is no significant increase in mitotic activity, and overall cellular organization is maintained without evidence of nuclear abnormalities."

There is a noticeable absence of glandular structures, highlighting a lack of differentiation typical of poorly differentiated carcinomas. The architecture lacks the organized structure seen in well-differentiated tissues."

The nuclei are densely stained, and the cells possess a moderate amount of cytoplasm. This pleomorphism is accompanied by irregular distribution within the tissue."
