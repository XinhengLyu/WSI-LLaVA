# ![WSI-LLaVA Logo](static/image/wsi-logo_16.png) WSI-LLaVA: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Whole Slide Image

**WSI-LLaVA** is a multimodal large language model designed for Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, bridging the gap between gigapixel WSIs and textual descriptions. It introduces innovative methods and benchmarks for advancing pathology-focused AI research.

## üìÇ Open Resources

We are committed to transparency and open science. Currently, the following resources are available:

- **[Test Dataset](./dataset/)**: A subset of VQA pairs and WSI data covering 30 cancer types, including a testing set of 208 WSIs with 4,119 VQA pairs.
- **Train Dataset**: *Coming Soon*.
- **Pre-trained Weights**: *Coming Soon*.

> **Note:** Additional dataset partitions and fine-tuned weights will be released in future updates.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

WSI-LLaVA consists of three core components:
1. **WSI Encoder**: Processes gigapixel WSIs for feature extraction.
2. **Projection Layer**: Aligns WSI features with textual embeddings.
3. **Large Language Model**: Generates context-aware and clinically relevant textual responses.

The training strategy incorporates three key stages for optimal performance on gigapixel WSIs.

## üìä WSI-Bench

In clinical practice, morphological features such as tissue and cellular structural abnormalities play a critical role in diagnosis. Existing models often overlook these crucial details. To address this, we propose **WSI-Bench**:

- **Scope**: 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs, spanning 30 cancer types and sourced from 8,368 patients.
- **Tasks**: 11 pathology-focused VQA tasks designed to evaluate three major pathological capabilities.
